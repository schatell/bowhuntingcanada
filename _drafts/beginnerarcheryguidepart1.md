## Shooting a bow

It sure does look intimidating at first look. On a compound bow you have all those cable and wheel and stuff bolted to the bow, where to start? What is good? What do you need? I will get into this very subject in this article in the most simplistic way possible so you can get into this great activity that is shooting a bow!

**Note that I will treat mostly about compound bows**

*****

## Parts

#### Main parts

All compound bows are build on the same principle and the parts are all called the same, the main “body” of the bow is called the **riser**. It is the piece of (often) aluminum where the grip is located that is vertical when you hold the bow.

Then at both end of the riser you have the **limbs**. Those are what determine the **draw weight** of the bow, meaning the amount of force required to pull the bow back. Those limb flexes when the bow is drawn and provide the force pushing the arrow.

Those limb each have **cams** at their ends. The cams are the more or less round wheels that your cable and string are attached to. Those are critical in the design of a compound bow. They are the main part that differentiates a compound from a traditional bow.

The **string and cables** are attached to those cam and make them rotate. The string and cables are made from the same material. The difference is that the string is where your arrow will clip on, and is located the farthest from the riser. It also have a loop around where the arrow will clip called the **D-Loop**. The role of the cable will be explained in detail later in this article.

Compound bow also have a **cable rod**, this is a rod that is attached to the riser and in which the cable rides. It's main purposes is to keep the cable away from the arrow path where fired.

#### Accessories

Of course a compound bow need accessories to work. The arrow is guided through the shot process by the **arrow rest**. There is a multitude of style of arrow rest, but all serve the same purpose, which is to guide the arrow toward the target during the shot process. It keep the arrow from falling of the bow, and maintains it in an ideal position during its launching.

You, the shooter, will need a way to aim. For this you use the **sight** in conjunction with the **peep sight**. The peep sight is piece of metal or plastic inserted in you string with an allow circle for your eye to see through. You align both sight and peep sight to form you **sight picture**. Note that this peep sight is adjustable in height to accommodate your height, body type and face structure.

Most archer use **stabilizer**. They are a rod with counter weight pointing toward the target and bolted into the riser. Most targeted at hunter will feature some kind of noise reduction as well. The main goal with stabilizer is to, in fact, stabilize your sight picture. Tournament archer will have long and heavy stabilizer as well as side stabilizer, those are not really used for hunting since they are cumbersome to shoot into confined environment.

Finally the archer use a **release** to fire the shot. The release is held by the archer and clipped onto the D-Loop. When the archer want to fire, the release is activated, the shot break and the arrow is launched. There is many style of releases, most targeted at hunter are of a style called “wrist strap”. Advanced archer will use one of the many “handheld style” however and those have many advantages. But this is for another article.

## Bringing it together

#### Function

**Important note to never fire your bow without an arrow in it. This could result in break of equipment or even worse some serious injury.**

A compound bow function the following way. When it is drawn, the archer will pull against the increasing force dictated by the draw weight. During this motion, the limb are being pulled under pressure and the cams are slowly rotating. Once a certain percentage of the pulling motion have been achieved, the cam rotate to their final position and the draw weight reduce significantly. Why is that? Well the force that the archers was pulling against the string is now stored in the cables. The cam rotation is what permit this transfer of energy to the cable and this is what set a compound bow apart from a traditional bow.

#### Draw cycle

The motion performed by the archer is called the **draw cycle**. During this cycle, the archer will achieve the **peak weight** of the cycle, the feel the **valley** of the cam, where the archer feel the “dumping” of the weight pulled. The amount of weight taken off the archers hand is calculated in **let-off**. Most bowhunting bow will have let off around 85%, meaning that the archer now hold only 15% of the peak weight. Those number are, of course, subject to change by bow model and manufacturers.
