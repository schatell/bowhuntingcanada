## In need of an early season jacket

Last season I was looking at getting a jacket for my early season archery deer hunting. I went to my local store to look at the different offering. Making researches on the internet as any other gear junky would, I stumbled on the new line of hunting clothes from Big Bill and decided to make the purchase. Here are my thoughts on this jacket.

*****

## Hunting jacket

Big Bill is primarily a work clothing company that recently started offering a hunting line. I have a hard time finding detailed information, but they claim that all of their clothing are made in Canada and in the USA. This is a plus for the consumer since it often means higher quality. This jacket first caught my attention because of its low price compared to what other offerings I was looking at. Price for retail was $155 CAD and I really think you get a lot for your money with this jacket.

### Usage

This jacket can keep me warm enough in the early season but does not provide any wind stopping capability to your system. It is best used as the top layer in your layering system as far as temperature rating goes. However, I had a hard time using it as a middle layer later in the season and ended up not using it in this role at all. The reason for that is that the jacket is fairly longer than a regular cut jacket. It was uncomfortable to wear under any other garment.

See my post on the layering system. LINK HERE

### Materials

The jacket is made of 80% merino wool and 20% nylon. I am a fan of merino wool for hunting. For one, it is naturally antibacterial, meaning your smell won't stay on the jacket, and two, wool is dead quiet. Both of those characteristics make this the perfect material for a hunting jacket.

### Extra feature

The jacket has adjustable torso straps on both sides. You can cinch them down to adjust it's cut.

 You can also adjust for sleeve fit with the leather protector on each arm. Those would help when making a shot by removing extra fabric from the way of your bow string.

  The jacket also has a high collar that really comes handy in colder temperatures at dawn and dusk but does not provide a hood which would be a plus for sure. Note that the collar doesn't have a port for your safety harness tether. I always wear a safety harness while hunting and the cut of the jacket being longer is very uncomfortable while wearing the harness over it. I plan on having a sewer adding this feature on mine as I like to wear mine under my main jacket.

### Harness compatibility

One of the main downside to the jacket is the lack of a port for feeding your safety harness tether, that would not be so much of a problem without the fact that having a longer cut to the jacket actually become very uncomfortable when wearing my harness over it. The straps for the leg get tight when the jacket is moving since it's too long. I have a plan of getting it modified to have a feeding port for the tether, that way I can wear my harness under the jacket.

### Solid color

I am of the option that camouflage caters more to the hunter than for the species hunted. I feel that movement plays a bigger role in the animal spotting you than what pattern of camo you are wearing. That being said I would recommend that if you buy that jacket, buy it in the solid green color. It is a perfect shade of green and I would feel comfortable using it in a tree stand as well as in a ground blind. I would probably put it to use this next spring turkey season as well. I would advise against getting the camo version, simply because it is ugly as sin.

## Conclusion

This jacket fills a very narrow niche for me. It is not as versatile as the other early season jacket that I looked as it is not windproof. However, what job it does, it does very well. I always wanted to grab this jacket, even when it was way too cold for it. The main downside again is problems that it gives me with my harness. I will modify mine in the next few months to get it ready for next season of tree stand hunting which should resolve the problem.

Overall this is a comfortable jacket that is quiet and perfectly in tune with our sport of bow hunting. Even better that it comes at a very reasonable price tag! I would give this piece of equipment a 7.5/10 and would have no trouble to recommend it if you need an early season jacket without windproof capability.
