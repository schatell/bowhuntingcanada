Safety warning blablabla


## Being Mobile

Being a mobile hunter gives you a clear edge over the other hunter that always hunt the same spot over and over. You can quickly adapt to the most recent deer pattern and always be ready to strike when the right time come. However, you need to get familiarized with a couple of technique to stay safe and efficient when climbing a new tree. Getting up a tree without deer knowing can be a challenge in itself. This is why I created this guide to help you if you are new to it.

## Equipment required

In this guide I will talk about using a set up that I am familiar with: the climbing stick and hang on stand method. For this you will require:
One hang-on stand of your choice
A number of climbing sticks
A hunting safety harness.
Two lineman belt
You hunting backpack
Your bow and arrows
Three rope with cheap carabiner attach. To pull your gear up.
To be in decent shape
One lifeline (required only if you will leave the stand in the tree)

#### Lineman belt

It is important with this method to have two lineman belt to climb safely. I personally do my own because it is cheaper and they are of better quality this way. It is fairly simple to make. First you need 11mm static climbing rope, for exemple Samson predator rope. Then you will need a prusik knot rope. For that I use 7mm mammut rope made for this purpose. Get one end of your 11mm rope in a loop using a overhand knot and tie a simple knot on the other end. Tie the 7mm rope together using an overhand knot forming a circle and tie it as a prusik knot on the main rope. Then clip a carabiner on the prusik.

The Loop on the main rope can be attached to your lineman belt attachment point on your safety harness and the carabiner clip on the other side.

Why do you need two of those belt? Well if you ever need to get over a limb, you can switch belt going over the limb while still staying attached while making the transition. Also those belt serve as a tree strap while in your stand. Having two also permit to attach in the treestand while staying secure with your second belt. The prusik knot allow you to adjust the length of the belt to better conform to the tree size, and the simple knot at the end of the main cord keep the prusik from ever sliding off the rope.

## System

Having is system will save you a lot of time, climb up and down the tree and frustration. This is why I am writing this article. Climbing a tree this way have a learning curve that I hope to save you as much as possible.

The most important thing is to have order in your system and to always follow the steps in the right order. That way you can't forget a step and need to climb back down.

#### Before the hunt.

First step would be to find the area you want to hunt. I can't really help you out with this but always consider your most recent informations. Many people choose to hunt food, travel corridor or near bedding area.
Pack your stuff correctly, I always have my stand with backpack straps, climbing stick and backpack mounted on the platform. That way I have my hand free to hold my bow.

#### Preliminary steps

Select the right tree. Always get a tree that seem healthy and is big enough to support your and your equipment weight. Having a tree without a crotch will be easier to climb. Also look for feature to hide your silhouette without impending your shooting capability.
One at the tree, remove everything from your back and set it on the ground. Unclip your backpack and sticks from your pack.
Determine the direction the stand will face. I like to have it 90 degree from my stick, that way I don't have my stick directly beneath my stand platform.
Starting a the bottom of the tree, install the first climbing stick on the tree. The height here is important to get right and everybody is different since it differ with leg length. Get familiar with this stuff before hunting season.
Once this first sticks secure on the tree, attach your stuff using the rope with carabiner in the following order. First attach your treestand to your safety harness, then your backpack to your stand and finally your bow to your backpack. Make sure all of those rope are free and not all stuck together.
Put one climbing stick on each side of your safety harness, you might need to make paracord loop to secure them. If you have three left, secure one with the strap around your shoulder.

#### Climbing the tree

Start by unclipping one of your lineman belts from your safety harness, pass it around the tree trunk and clip it back to your harness.
Adjust the length to be comfortable leaning into your lineman belt. Always keep your lineman belt above your hip.
Climb the first sticks until your foot is on the first or second row of step and place the next stick up.
Continue climbing until all of your sticks are on the tree.

#### Obstacle

 If you ever need to get around a limb, connect your second lineman belt over it while still connected with your first one. Once connected above, unclip from the one under and continue the climb. Lineman belt not used currently can be wrapped around your shoulder and clipped to your harness in a way that doesn't hinder movement.

#### Stand transition

This is statistically the most dangerous stro so be extra careful.

When you are at the right height, be sure have the lineman belt tight to the tree to help you with balance for those next step.
Pick the cord connected to your stand that is still on the ground and start pulling your stand up. Be careful of not bumping it into the tree and scaring everything away.
Place your stand slightly at an angle to the side of your stick. This help getting in and out of it.
Install your tree stand on the tree per manufacturer recommendation. Be sure to cam it properly, meaning that as you lower the platform, the strap should tighten by themselves.
Using the same technique as with limbs, get on your platform switching lineman belt.

#### Finalising

Once in your stand, take your unused lineman belt and set it up as a treestand. Take the tag end and going around the tree, feed it through the loop end. Attach your tether to this strap and place it at an height where it will be tight when sitting.
Once secure, detach your lineman belt and start pulling on your backpack rope.
Once your backpack up, set a hook to the tree to set your pack on.
Finally bring your bow up.
Hope to kill a deer!

## Practice

Wow! This is quite extensive. All said and done however, with a little bit of practice I am sure I can get up a tree this is way in about 10 minutes. This is of course taking my time to be as silent as possible.

Take a few hours during summer to climb different trees presenting different climbing scenario, you will thank yourself come hunting season.

And of course be safe and always climb to a height you feel comfortable, there is deer being killed on the ground, 10 feet up in a tree as well as 25 feet up. Keep it enjoyable by making sure you are comfortable.
