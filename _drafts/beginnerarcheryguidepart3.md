## Your archery shop

Now that you understand how the bow work and how to choose arrow, it is time to buy. The most important step is to find a reputable bow shop to deal with. Ask around in archery club for the best place to go. Don't be afraid to go in and talk to them without buying anything. Buying a bow is a matter of personal choice, and building a rapport with the shop and technician you will deal with is an important part of the whole experience. I go to my shop a few time per year, sometime to order something, or to get some work done on my bow, and I talk to the people there. I found my place and have trust that they will do good to my set up, they know me by name and I send them a lots of clients that way a trust is established.

## Bow and accessories

Once you have a shop that you trust, it is time to get a bow. Choose a bow that correspond to your budget and personal preference. There is a lot of good bows on the market and the choice often go down to personal preferences. However, it is important that you select on that give you the proper draw length that your shop will help you measure. It is also important to get a bow that you can pull back without being a strain. Remember that you will need to draw it back in the heat of the moment while hunting, and sometime in imperfect condition. Bows come in different draw weight rating, exemple 50-60 pounds. This mean that this particular bow can go as low as 50 pounds and as high as 60. Yes you need draw weight to kill an animal, but you also need precision, which is easier accomplished when you can handle the weight.

As far as accessories goes, I would say to get the best possible, even to the point of reducing the price of the bow you decide to buy. Good accessories can last a long time and you can transfer them to a new bow if you ever change. They also increase your accuracy by a lot compared to cheap, plastic one.

The most important for me to get the best you can would be the arrow rest, since it's the part that guide your arrow during launch, and a release. I would highly, highly recommend that any new archer go look at what John Dudley do with its brand “NockOn” an get a Silverback release from him, or a Carter Evolution. Those type of tension activated release teach archer how to properly execute a surprise shot, which is critical to anyone wanting to be accurate. The only downside is that they are expensive and can be intimidating. But I would still strongly recommend to look into them if you truly wants to dedicate yourself to archery.

Bottom line, you should get yourself some nice accessories even if it mean to cut a little bit on the bow. You probably going to change bow someday but those accessories could last you many years to come.

## Initial setup

Your local shop will setup your bow if you buy it from them, or they can even setup a used bow if you pay their fees. They will set up your d-loop and peep sight at the right height. They probably will make you draw a couple time and will work on your bow until it fits you properly then send you on your way. You need however to have a little bit of knowledge on some simple setup that you can easily do yourself. You will require a simple set a Allen key to do most of those adjustments.

What you will want to adjust yourself is the arrow rest position from left to right and from top to bottom. This is used to adjust the way the arrow is launched and can will affect the point of impact of your arrow. Look into “paper tuning" and “walk back tuning" to learn to time your arrow rest. I will prepare a post on this website in the next few weeks.

You will also want to learn to adjust your sight position to aim where your arrow hits. Most sight adjust using those same Allen key mentioned previously. To adjust a sight is time consuming, but fairly simple. Simply follow the arrow. If your arrow mist high, move your pin higher. If it hits right, move your pin right and etc…

The next and last post on this series will guide you through actually shooting your bow for the first time.
