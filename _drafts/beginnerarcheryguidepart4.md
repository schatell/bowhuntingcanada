## First time at the range

Your first time is the beginning of your journey to become a proficient bowhunter. Get familiar with your range and go often! All archery is good and there is a lot of fun to be had! There is 3d shoot and target shooting, and it's all fun. Of course you also need to be safe. Be familiar with your range specific rules and always respect them. Know your shooting lane and never shoot when someone is down range. Otherwise, follow this guide to a stet by step process to shoot your bow.

## A shot

A shot is executed with mind and body connected. This is one of the great thing with archery, you need to be calm and composed for the best result. Practice will make perfect!

Here is the steps I follow to my shot process:

Nock an arrow.
Look at my target and position my body to “point” in that direction.
Look at my feet, do I have a solid stance? Feet are about shoulder width, front foot slightly open to the target.
Stand proud and tall, raise the arm holding the bow directly at the target.
Pull the release hand directly back toward my face. The hand holding the bow is not gripping, the grip is rested against the thumb pad, next to the life line.
Anchor position. The hand holding the release is touching it's anchoring point, sting is at the corner of the mouth and tip of the nose.
Aim at the target, both eyes are open at all time and the focus of the eyes is on the target, not the sight. Peep sight is centered around the sight housing in your vision. Pin movement is acceptable.
Depending on your release, remove the safety or put your finger and the trigger.
Using your back muscle, increase the pressure exerted on your release. Gradually augment the pressure until you achieve a surprise shot.
Keep your bow arm up until the shot reach the target, your hand holding the release should automatically be directed above your shoulder.

Those are the 10 steps that I try to always follow. I am not perfect and sometime I fail at the task. The important thing in archery is repeatability, so I note my mistake and do better the next time around. Slowly but surely, my shots gets better and better which I hope will make me a better bowhunter with time. I also practice year around and try to shoot a minimum of 3 time per week.

## Making adjustment

Making adjustment on your setup is a delicate operation. You want to adjust your sight and rest until you are sure that you are on target. If you have a bad day, don't change anything considering only that day. Leave the equipment the way it is and come back to it once you feel better. This will eliminate a lot of frustration and setup time.

To truly enjoy and perform at archery, as I said earlier, your body need to be in tune with your mind. A lot of archer develop with time what is called “target panic". It is something that take control of the archers mind when executing a shot that force him to make a rushed shot by literally punching the trigger of its release. This is way I have a strong opinion about release permitting a surprised shot. I can't thank John Dudley enough to have helped me cure this target panic that I was starting to have myself. People with target panic rush to hit the trigger as soon as the pin is in the center of the target which result in jolting and simply bad result. Those archer can't accept that the movement in their pin is normal, we are not machine after all. By having a surprise shot, the archer get comfortable with the float of the pin, and they need to stay near the center until the shot actually break.

By putting all of those element together, you should accomplish a lot in your archery career that is ahead of you. Be it the biggest buck of your life, or a friendly 3d competition, you should get outside and enjoy that wonderful sport that is archery. Hoping that this guide helped you!
