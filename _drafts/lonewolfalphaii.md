## Lone Wolf

Lone Wolf is the company that for a long time was at the forefront of the treestand technologies. It is responsible for the invention of the cast aluminium platform in tree stand permitting a close to perfectly silent sit. By itself, this is a pretty big deal, but lone wolf doesn’t stop here, the lone wolf alpha II is loaded with features that make it a bowhunter best companion!

*****

## Features

#### Size

Lone Wolf stands come in 2 sizes, the alpha II is the largest of the two with a platform measuring 30 inches long by 19.5 inches wide. The seat is the same on both models measuring 14 by 12 inches, seat height is set at 21 inches high measuring from the platform. The height of the seat is what I especially love from this stand. It make a big difference on all day sit.

#### Levelling

What make this stand even more comfortable is that you can level the stand in 2 directions; from side to side and from top to bottom. The stand sit on the tree on the “offset bracket”. This allow you to level the entire stand from left to right if you find yourself climbing a non-perfect tree, and let's be honest, perfect tree are a rare commodity. You can then use the “self levelling system" that adjust the length of the cable holding the platform. This allow you to adjust the platform angle and also accomodate a tree leaning in this direction. You can also finally adjust the seat angle, providing maximum adjustably, and thus, comfort. All of those feature are really nice to have, when in the wood with my lone wolf I know I can climb virtually any tree providing that they are safe.

#### Packability

The Lone Wolf system is designed with mobile hunting in mind. A lot of us are hunting public land, so a mobile set-up is often the right answer. Lone Wolf integrate aluminium in its design, making this stand a portable solution. However, if you do intend on moving a lot, you could get the smaller “assault II” version in the Lone Wolf line, that way you save yourself about 3 pounds of material to haul into the wood each time(14 vs 11 pounds). If you decide to buy climbing sticks to go with your stand, know that they are made to mate with the folded stand, making it easy to transport the entire system combined with the provided backpack straps.

#### Versa button

The Versa button is a feature that merit its own section to itself. The Versa button is a disk that come of a post on the square aluminium tubing on your stand. A picture explain it better:

It is use to secure strap by their end loop. This make it WAY easier to attach when juggling with all of your stuff in the dark. Simply loop the strap around and then tighten it and you are done. Not feeding, no ratcheting, just loop around and cinch the webbing. Lone Wolf use them for their climbing sticks also. People go as far as buying some as part and retrofit them to other brand's stand and climbing sticks. It's how good they are.

## Real world use

#### Price and patent

Although this stand has a great number of killer features, there is still some down side: namely the price. To get yourself into a Lone Wolf you will need to pay the price. Some might say that you could get a similar stand today that incorporates most if not all of the same features. The patent on cast aluminum platform being expired, a couple of company now build stand using the same technology. This increase competition and bring the cost down. A Lone Wolf Alpha II MSRP is set at 259.99 USD. This doesn't include any climbing stick so you'll still need to get a way to actually climb your tree.

#### Silence treatment

Being the quietest stand on the market right now doesn't cut it for me. Don't get me wrong, this stand is very quiet. It attach rock solid to the tree a doesn't make a whole lot of noise. But there is still some noise that the stand could do and alert animals nearby. For example, stand stand can clunk when packing it in, you could make a noise with the strap buckle trying to tie them, or even worse, rubbing your boots on the cable make a strange squeaky sound for me. All of those problem are, thankfully, fixable. You will however need a little bit of elbow grease and time to remedies the situation. I would not waste time explaining here how to do it since there is already a perfect resource for that exact subject. [Here is the link to the video that will solve all of your problem with a noisy stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_22dM-YGnY&t=617s).

#### Packing in

Packing in with the stand on your back is fairly easy. However be aware that weight quickly add up. Consider what to bring in your backpack and try to stay light. The normal way of attaching the climbing sticks to the stand is a little flawed since the sit down the middle of the stand on your back, leaving you almost no place to strap a backpack that is comfortable. I strap mine on one side, but this make it awkward to travel long distances. Also the backpack straps provided are not padded and quickly dig into your shoulder and are very uncomfortable. I would suggest two upgrade in that sense:
Buy the padded backpack straps.
Buy an aftermarket way of transporting the climbing sticks.
You can get the stick quiver from Lone Wolf themselves, or the [“sticks talons”](http://www.mobilehuntinggear.com), those would permit the middle of the stand to be free to strap you hunting backpack to it, making it more centered and thus more comfortable.

## Final thought

I’ve had the chance to have been hunting in the stand for the entire last season, and I am overall very happy with the result. This stand is a great ally when getting into secluded or new spots. Although heavier than the Assault II variant, I still feel this stand is valuable when being mobile. The way I have used mine last season is by making short term set, meaning I would set up and leave the stand until I had hunted the location for about two or three times, then I move the set to a new location depending on deer movement and the principle of “most recent informations”

Overall Lone Wolf is still synonyms with quality and a loved and recognize brand when it come to whitetail hunter. I think every serious bowhunter need to have at least one mobile set up and the Lone Wolf is still the leader in that category.

As far as an evaluation, I would still give the Lone Wolf alpha II a solid 9.5/10. The last 0.5 point taken because I had to make some add-on and modification to make it truly as silent as possible. Otherwise I would not had anything to an already proven and loved product.
