## In need of an early season jacket

Last season I was looking at getting a jacket for my early season archery deer hunting. I went to my local store to look at the different offering. Making researches on the internet as any other gear junky would, I stumble on the new line of hunting clothes from Big Bill.

## Hunting jacket

What first caught my eyes was that although they looked like a quality garment, they were als fairly cheaper(at about 155 CAD)than the other brands I was looking at.

#### Usage

This jacket can keep me warm enough in the early season and is best used as the top layer in your layering system. I tried later in the season to use it more as a middle layer and had some trouble with it. Mainly because of the cut of the jacket, it is difficult to keep it tucked underneath a bigger layer. The jacket is, in fact, cut a little longer than what I am used to in regular hunting clothing and really shine when used as your top layer, in that role it is very comfortable.

See my post on the layering system here.

#### Materials

The jacket is made of 80% merino wool and 20% nylon. I am a fan of merino wool for hunting. For one, it is naturally antibacterial, meaning your smell won't stay on the jacket, and two, wool is dead quiet. Both of those characteristics make this the perfect material for a hunting jacket.

#### Extra feature

The jacket has adjustable torso straps on both sides. You can cinch them down to adjust it's cut. You can also adjust for sleeve fit with the leather protector on each arm. Those would help when making a shot by removing extra fabric from the way of your bow string. The jacket also has a high collar that really comes handy in colder temperatures at dawn and dusk.

#### Harness compatibility

One of the main downside to the jacket is the lack of a port for feeding your safety harness tether, that would not be so much of a problem without the fact that having a longer cut to the jacket actually become very uncomfortable when wearing my harness over it. The straps for the leg get tight when the jacket is moving since it's too long. I have a plan of getting it modified to have a feeding port for the tether, that way I can wear my harness under the jacket.

## Solid color

I am of the option that camouflage is more for the hunter than for the hunted. I fell that movement plays a bigger role in the animal spotting you than what pattern of camo you are wearing. That being said I would recommend that if you buy that jacket, buy it in the solid green color. It is a perfect shade of green and I would feel comfortable using it in a tree stand as well as in a ground blind. I would probably put it to use this next spring turkey season as well. I would advise against getting the camo version, simply because it is ugly as sin.

## Conclusion

This jacket fills a very narrow niche for me. It is not as versatile as the other early season jacket that I looked as it is not windproof. However, what job it does, it does with perfection. My hands always wanted to grab that jacket, even when it was way too cold for it. The main downside again is the lack of comfort while wearing a safety harness. I will modify mine in the next few months to get it ready for next season of tree stand hunting.

Overall this is a comfortable jacket that is quiet and perfectly in tune with our sport of bow hunting. Even better that it comes at a very reasonable price tag! I would give this piece of equipment a 7.5/10 and would have no trouble to recommend it if you need an early season jacket without windproof capability.
