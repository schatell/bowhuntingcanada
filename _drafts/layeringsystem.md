## Enjoying time outdoors...

...often come down to being comfortable, and this is almost always related to feeling cool or warm enough. While hunting whitetail, turkey, moose or any other game, a layering system can really benefit you in that domain.

But what is a layering system? It is a way to dress that permit your body to regulate its temperature more efficiently by using multiple layer of clothes one on top of the others. Most system will be include a total of three layer name: the base layer(closest to skin), the mid layer(or insulation layer) and the outer layer.

## Base layer

Is the closest one to your skin. It's role is simple: wick away the moisture from your skin perspiration and keep you dry. It is no secret that a body will get colder faster if wet, especially when exposed to wind. Combine that with the long hours of sitting in one place and you get a dangerous combination.

Those clothes are most of the time form fitting. The closest to fit to your body and the more efficiently they can wick that moisture off your skin. For hunting purposes try to keep them a neutral color but you don't need to get camo one since you will rarely get down to that level.

They could be made of synthetic or natural fibers. I would highly recommend you get yourself a set in merino wool. Merino is not the toughest material on earth around but it's quality far outweigh its shortcomings. Here is a list of way merino is good for hunting:
-Keep it's insulation value when wet
-Naturally get rid of bacterial odor
-Silent
-Doesn't shine light

It can be a little itchy if you have not wore them ever but you quickly get used to it.

## Mid layer

The mid layer, also called insulation layer, sole purpose is to provide the insulation required between your base and outer layer. While the base layer keep you dry, the base layer provide loft and air space to insulate your body. This layer need to allow air to travel through it and permit the drying of your base layer.

Most often than not, those garment will be made out of synthetic material such as polyester. Think fleece type clothing. Sometime if the weather permits it, you could get down to this layer so think about color or camouflage if you intent on wearing this type of clothes while hunting. Something to note about synthetic is that they can retain odors so those need to be washed more often.

While this layer is important to keep you warm, this is probably the piece of clothing that might cost you the least amount of money. You can get some great piece of clothing at a reasonable price in this category. No need to shell out some big money, when a traditional fleece will serve you as well as any other high dollars pieces. Better save on this category and get yourself something a little nicer in the other two categories.

## Outer layer

The outer layer that you will want to wear is entirely dependant on the weather condition. For example, during early season you might only need a soft shell to cut the wind out. Later in the season you will need to step your game up and bring more of a winter jacket type of garment.

The outer layer is just that, the last piece of clothing between you and the outside environment. Of course the more you pay for the garment, the more technological feature you will have. Something that is worth considering is a type of fabric that “breathe”, meaning that it let moisture out but not in. This will help you system overall as the moisture wicked by you base layer need to go somewhere.

Watch for “brushed” type of fabric since they are less noisy than the hard-shell type. Windproof and rainproof will also be louder but are often required for comfort sake.

#### Rain specific clothing

Although technically outer layer, I like to think of rain gear as a somewhat separated category. I always bring a rain jacket in my backpack when rain is in the forecast. Remember that being wet is what will get you cold the fastest, so I always want to stay dry.

## Note about pants

The same principles also apply to your lower body, however I fell I get way less cold from the leg than from the upper body. More often than not I would wear a lighter pair of merino base layer than complete with a pair of pants for early season. Later, I will switch my pants to a pair of bibs. That way I can hunt all season pretty comfortably.

*****

## Accessories

When it come to accessories, you want to select to right ones to wear corresponding to the time of the year. For example I would not layer my socks, but have different pair that are adapted to different temperatures. Remember that the only way to stay hunting a long time is to be comfortable.

## Be smart using your layer

A system like this as many advantages. The greater one being its adaptability to the current situation. You can combine, remove and add layer to your system depending on the current state of the weather.

Always keep in mind that being wet will be the number one cause of being cold. You want to limit perspiration to a minimum. A great way of doing that is to be a little bit chilly when starting your walk to your stand. Transporting you backpack, bow, maybe even your treestand can quickly warm you up, and if you have all of your layer on you and are fully zipped up, you will start sweating. When you get situated in your stand and stop moving, you will quickly get chilly, then cold. This can ruin a hunt in a hurry.

Remember, stay dry and dress accordingly!
