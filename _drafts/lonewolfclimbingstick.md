**Please exercise safety when climbing trees. Always wear a safety harness and be sure to always have three points of contacts with the tree at all time.**

## Climbing sticks

Climbing sticks are a popular method of climbing trees by hunters. They allow the hunter to climb a crooked tree and limb don't get in the way of them like it would a normal ladder. Combining with a quality hang-on stand, you can climb virtually any tree and be more successful in your hunt. Let’s examine the set of Lone Wolf climbing sticks that I've put to the test last season.

## Mobile hunter

As part of my goal of extending my capacity as a bowhunter, I purchased a mobile set-up last year consisting of a Lone Wolf Alpha II combined with a set of four Lone Wolf climbing sticks. I had the chance to used them quite a lot and did multiple sits on a bunch of different sites.

The sticks are, in my mind the only reasonable way to be mobile using an hang-on stand since you could hardly move a complete 20 feets ladder each time you want to change spot.

## Price and feature

The Lone Wolf climbing stick are available as single, pack of 3 or pack of 4 and retail for $200USD for the pack of 4. They are a single step design, meaning that each step is a set up to the right or the left of the stick. Some other brands have double step design meaning that you have a step for each for or hand on each row. The design of the Lone Wolf allows the saving of weight but is quite uncomfortable when trying to set up your tree stand. I often find myself trying to juggle all of my gear and raising my treestand while trying to keep my balance on only one foot is sometimes frustrating. Maybe experience will play into that, I don't know. Once set-up, however, the problem disappear since you only need to climb up or down, and this is easily achievable alternating right and left foot/hand.

They are also made of aluminum and weight a total of about 10 pounds. They are made to mate one on top of the others bringing to the total package to a very manageable size. One thing you are sure to get with Lone Wolf is the ability to tuck everything easily in a nice transportable manner. Every piece fits with the next and everything is easily usable while in the field.

This is accentuated by the usage of the Versa button. It is a way to attach the strap that goes around the tree to the stick. Hang-on stand from Lone Wolf uses the same technology and it is one of the best feature ever on a hunting product. You can quickly attach your straps and cinch them tight in a fraction of a second.

Another advantage of the sticks is that if you need to place one to a slight angle to accommodate the tree, each section being short enough comfort to the shape way better than any long regular hunting ladder.

## Competition

Lone Wolf caters to the most freak hunters out there. They make some of the best product around and hunter buy their product with confidence of what they will get. However, I feel that the climbing stick from Lone Wolf doesn't offer anything more than the current competition. Just to name a few, you could get: Muddy Aerolite, XOP climbing stick, Hawk Helium Climbing stick and I am sure a myriad of other brands. All of those models have different characteristics that make them slightly unique, some have dual steps, some have longer or shorter length of sticks, etc… although I only tested the Lone Wolf one, I am sure that you can find the set that conveys the most to you. Most of them are in the same price range as well.

## Noise reduction

As with their tree stand, Lone Wolf climbing sticks are pretty good at being quiet out of the box. I went ahead and did a couple of modification on mine to bring them at a level that I am more comfortable with. The worst is all the metal on metal contact that can happen on the main aluminum tubing and the buckle strap. A product that is called “stealth strips" is available to cover the tubing. It is, in my opinion, a must-have. You can, in fact, apply this product on any climbing stick you have, they really do make a big difference. For the buckle, just recover them with felt of bicycle tubing. Do it properly so that the buckle button is not depressed by the tire. Cut little slot around it to relieve the pressure on it. Doing those two simple step will bring your stealth game to a whole new level.
