## Bow sight

The bow sight might be the accessory that the archer have the most direct contact with while shooting. We all spend an awful lot of time making sure our mark are set at the right place. Everytime we change something on our bow, we need to readjust our sight. For this reason, a quality sight is highly important to get as accurate as possible. Be sure to get a quality one. But when choosing a new sight, an important question arise: should you get a traditional multi pin or a single pin movable sight? This is what I am trying to answer here.

## Sight type

#### Single pin sight

A single pin sight, as its name imply, have only one pin situated in the dead center of the sight housing. The archer aim at different distance moving the complete sight housing up and down on a track fixed to the sight bracket. A single pin has the distinction advantage of providing a clearer sight picture then it's multi pin counter part simply because there is only one pin in the whole housing. This allow the archer to focus more easily on the target and to also have a better whole view of said target.

Having the housing sliding on this track also allow the use of sight tapes. Meaning you have an arrow pointing at a distance on the track with a tape that indicate the distance aimed for. This is also a big advantage that the single pin provide since you have mark for every yard(or meter) on this sight tape. Say that you have a deer at 18 meter from you, you can adjust your sight to exactly 18 meters and not try to gap shoot between your 10 and 20 meters pin.

This same advantage come at a huge disadvantage when hunting. You actually need to physically move your sight to take an accurate shot. If the animal move during full draw, you might need to let down, range again, dial the distance to your sight and come to full draw again. This can quickly become frustrating.

#### Multi pins sight

Multi pin sight are what most bowhunter will have on it's bow. Its housing is fixed when in use(move for adjustment purposes) and have multiple pins in its housing that you can set at different interval. Most people set them at multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30 meters etc..). This type of setup permit the hunter to quickly adjust to any move an animal might might while at full draw, however, the sight picture will be way more “busy” then if using a single pin.

They can come with different number of pins between 3 and 9. I think 5 might be enough for almost any bowhunter. This give you a pin to 50 meters and doesn't get as cluttered as the 7 and 9 pins option out there.

## Decisions, decision…

When it come to make a choice, one need to consider the pro and the cons of each system. You can only decide by yourself what is best for you. The way I see it, is that a single pin give you more possibility for accuracy and less cluttered in you line of sight but also come at the disadvantage of having to adjust it everytime you need to take a shot. What I did to circumvent this problem while hunting last season is that I ranged my probable lanes for shots and preadjusted the sight for what I thought would be the most likely shot. This worked great for me as I didn't had to move my sight when a doe presented the opportunity(that I chose to not shoot).

Ultimately, however, I have taken the decision to get back on a multi pins sight for this next season. I will still keep my single for turkey season that is coming up in the next few weeks as I don't want to change my system at the last minute.

What drove my decision is the fact that I might need to take a shot that is not the same then when I was drawing back. Also I intend on doing a couple of 3d tournament this summer and simply having a movable sight bring me in the “open” division where I would be at a great disadvantage with my current equipment.

Choosing a sight is a matter of personal choice and one you need to make by yourself. I needed to try it first to truly make a final decision for myself. In the past I tried to make my bow do everything, from indoor to 3d to hunting. I have come to the realisation that this is far from optimal and that I need to take my equipment to the best of their specialised task. This is why I intend on having on bow dedicated for hunting and one for target in the future. But for now, my goal is to make my hunting bow as best as possible for me and this imply having a multiple pins sight.

I highly encourage everyone to see for themselves and try both of them and see what's best for you. This is how you will drive your skills forward and become great at archery!
