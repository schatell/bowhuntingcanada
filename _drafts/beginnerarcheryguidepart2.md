## The arrow…

… is a critical component of your bow. It needs to be as accurate as you are, and there is a lot of factor that contribute to a good arrow.

*****

## Components

All arrow start as a simple aluminium or carbon tubing, called the *shaft*. On the front of the arrow, of course, would be a *point*. Points can be of two type: *field point* for practice and *Broadhead* for hunting. Those point are, for the most part, screwed in and are rated by weight using grain. They screw into the arrow *insert* which are glued to the inside of the shaft. They are exception to this rule, you could also get *outsert* that protrude and go over the arrow shaft.

On the back side of the arrow, if where the *nock* is. The nock is made of plastic and clip onto your string. Most nock are push in type, but there is also a type called *pin nock* that are easily replaceable because they simple fit on a pin that is part of a *bushing* that fit on the back side of the arrow. Those are mostly found on the target side of archery.

And of course there is the *fletching* that give the arrow it's distinctive look. Those could be made from *feathers* or, more commonly for compound shooter, *vanes*. Vanes are simply plastic feathers. There is a myriad of shape, sizes, weight, color, etc… to be found for vanes. Sometime arrow will be fletched over *arrow wrap* that simply protect the arrow when an old set of fletching need to be removed to install some fresh one.

Those are all the part of a typical arrow. Now let see how to get the right arrow for you.

## Arrows tuning

Choosing and tuning your arrow is a exercise of balance. Different style of shooting call for different type of arrow set up. For bowhunting, current wisdom dictate to go with a slightly heavier arrows but still achieve some decent speed. A amount to shoot for is about 290 feets per seconds. That speed and weight is determiner by a couple of factor but everything start from your bow draw weight and the energy it deliver to the projectile.

#### Front of center

Front of center, known as *F.O.C.* is a critical metric for arrow accuracy. It is calculated is the percentage difference between the absolute center of the arrow versus the balancing point of the arrow, or the weighted center of the arrow.
There is a few calculators available online or  you can calculate it this way:
Get the total length from the groove of the nock to the end of the shaft and divide by two. This is result A
Find the balance point and get the length from this point to the groove in the nock. This is.result B
Subtract A - B
Multiply result by 100
Divide your result by the arrow overall length.

You should aim to have between 10 and 15 percent of F.O.C. for optimal result. Adjusting for this is accomplished two ways:
Reducing arrow overall weight and keeping point weight the same.
Augmenting point weight and keeping the shaft weight the same.

Augmenting the point weight could be made using a heavier weight, for exemple 125 grains instead of 100 grains, or, using a heavier insert. This would be my favorite method since there is more choice in 100 grains Broadhead category. Be weary that point weight affect my next topic, spine.

#### Spine

*Spine* is a unit of measure that calculate the amount of deflection, also called flex, of the arrow under a certain weight. The spine of the arrow is measured this following way. First, the arrow are cut at 29 inches and placed on two point 28 inches apart. Then a weight of 880 gram is place on the dead center of the arrow. The amount of inches the arrow is flexing is multiplied by 1000 to give the spine rating. For example an arrow flexing .4 inch will be a 400 spine.

Arrows are made available for a lot of specialty, but all will include a rating known as *spine*. Spine rating is simple, it provide the archer the knowledge of the stiffness of the spine. This is provided as a number, for exemple 500, 400, 340, etc… the lower the number, the stiffer the arrow is. But why do you need a certain spines arrow? Simply put, your arrow need to flex a certain amount to be precise. To much flex and you will lose accuracy, to stiff and the same problem arise. I would like to say that I am not a specialist about what those specific numbers are, however, I can't stress enough that, as an archer, you need to get the proper spined for you set up. This is the most critical step in choosing an arrow.

In the same line of arrow, when you get a stiffer spine, the arrow total weight will increase since the number of *grain per inch* increase as well.

Fortunately, this is rather easy to do. All manufacturers will provide a spine chart helping you making an informed decision. Basically, spine is affected by three thing: length of the arrow, point mass, and you bow’s draw weight.

The longer an arrow is, the weaker it is. The more point weight you add, the weaker it also get. The more weight you shoot the stiffer the arrow needs to be. For example, the same bow at 60 pound and 30 inches of draw shooting a 30 inches arrows with 100 grains of point weight will required a less stiff arrow if the arrow is shot at 31 inches of length using 150 grain points.

I will not provide any specific information on spine here, simply follow the spine chart provided on all manufacturers websites.

#### Adjusting those variables

When selecting an arrow, thing that would probably not chance are the arrow length and your bow draw weight. Choose a line of arrow you want to shoot and get on that manufacturers website to pull the spine chart. Select the spine that will match your setup as much as possible and determine if you want to shoot the heavier insert or the regular one as this will affect the final spine selected.

An overall heavier arrow will fly slower, but this will quiet your bow by quite a lot. There is also another factor to consider *momentum*.

#### Momentum…

… is the notion that a heavier object in motion is harder to stop than a lighter one. This translate to hunting that way: a slower but heavier arrow will have an increase likeliness to pass through an animal than a faster but lighter one. Overall the sweet spot for most set up seem to be about 290 feets per second. This is something to consider since it has a lot of added benefit.
