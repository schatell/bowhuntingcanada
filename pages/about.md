# Bow Hunting Canada

*****

## What is this website about?

I have created this website to talk about my passion: bows and bowhunting. Since I am located in Canada I decided to name the website "The Canadian Bowhunter". A great deal of information is already available online to archers and bowhunter, however, this information is sometime questionable or simply not addressed at people living in our climate. My goal is to learn, and provide as much wisdom as possible to new and older archers. I am a not so experienced bowhunter but still a decent shot on the range. I will tell you everything about my hunts, where I had success and where I failed, this way you can also learn with me.

## What kind of content can you expect?

I have a plan of publishing several type of content, but mainly written. You can also expect those articles to come with original pictures to help guide you and have a better idea of what is really going on during my adventures. As far as content type, I want to write about the equipment I have the chance to test, I am a gear junkie so I like to tinker with a lot of stuff so you'll surely ear about my opinion a lot. I also want to write about bows, tuning, shot process and everything in between. Of course I also want to talk about my hunts.

## Am I paid to talk about products?

No I am not, for now all the gear reviewed are stuff I bought with my own money. If this came to change, or if I was supplied with test unit, it will be mentioned at the top of the article.
