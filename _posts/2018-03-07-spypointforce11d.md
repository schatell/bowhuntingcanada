## The company

Spypoint might be the brand of camera I see the most around. In fact, every hunter that own cameras seem to have at least one in their arsenal. That might not be the case south of the border, but here it sure is. Spypoint is a company situated in Victoriaville, Quebec, they sell a variety of camera mainly aimed at the hunter or for security purposes.

## The unit

The model we are looking at right now is the Force-11D. It is a middle of the road model and MSRP is set at 229.99$(CAD of course), however, you can find it for way lower than that during sales season. The first thing that comes to mind when looking at the body of the camera is how small the footprint of the camera is. The body itself is thicker than a regular style sized hunting camera, however this dimension matter less to me. I found that when placing it on a tree, I had less trouble fitting it between branches or other defects around the trunk of the tree.

The camera control panel and the 2-inch screen is located under a panel that simply pops off the front of the camera itself. The latching clips are nice and big and very easy to operate and feel secure when latched. Contrary to the older style of Spypoint where you had to open the case and pivot the entire unit to access to the back of it, now, once installed on a tree, you can quickly access everything you need from the front of the camera.

The back of the camera is where you can attach the supplied strap and can have access to the battery compartment. You can access the battery under the panel with a simple captured screw. The strap attaches to a quick-detach bracket which permits to quickly get the camera on and off the bracket. This is a nice to have feature.

The supplied strap is not the best, I would suggest getting a mount that you can screw into the body of the camera. All Spypoint as far as I know come with this option. You can buy one, or even make one fairly easily and on the cheap. This has the advantage of being way more secure on the tree and the camera risk moving less with time spent outdoors.

## The control panel.

The control panel is located just under the front panel of the camera. It is simple enough to understand quickly without referring to the guide. You have an "up" and a "down" button, as well as an "ok" and a "back" button. The setting screen is downright simple, simply go to the setting pages and select what you prefer. To start using the camera, simply choose the desired mode (photo or video) and the main screen will display the time remaining before activation (60 seconds by default).

That main screen that I just mentioned is the highlights of this camera, it is where the "D" came from in the name, for display. The lower priced model (Force-10) does not have this feature. The camera permit you to check photos on the fly, or, even better, check what your camera sees before setting it. This for me was a learning curve with my traditional camera. Sometimes propping the camera up just a little bit can affect the angle greatly and be the difference between capturing a great shot or a mediocre one. I definitely think this is the best feature of this camera.

## Battery

This camera run on 6 AA battery. The problem I have run into with this camera is mainly with the battery. I can run a long time using lithium batteries, about 6 months. However, the camera battery indicator on my unit does not seem to work reliably. It took me a while to figure out why my camera was not taking pictures, yet would still power on when I went on site to check the card. The camera had enough power to go to the menu but would die soon after. As I don't want to leave my scent to long in the deer woods, I was just grabbing the card and got the hell out. After a few weeks of this and a fresh change of battery the problem was solved, but I would've like to know sooner.

Spypoint innovates in the power category, if you have the cash for it, they offer a solar-powered model. Couple with AA batteries, word is they rarely run out of power. But I've never tested them myself or know someone reputable to attest to it. They are, as far as I know, the only company on the market offering this type of product.

## Pictures

**Please note that the picture shown here have been optimized for web hosting and the quality is slightly lower than in real life**

This camera boasts a reasonable 11MP. However, when cameras are concerned, don't be impressed by high megapixel count. Megapixel is only one metric and it doesn't dictate all result. I would say the daylight pictures are clear and bright. One of my spots is under a thick patch of evergreen trees and the light is really low, even when the sun is strong in the summer. The pictures in this spot, although not bright, are still perfectly clear but somewhat grainy.

Here is an example:

![LowLight Photo]({{ "/assets/img/posts/force11d/PICT0117-min.JPG" | absolute_url }})

In normal light condition the camera really give it's best. It is also really fast to capture its first image, I would advise to set it to take multiple captures on detection, this way you are sure to have the animal centered in the frame. The camera is so fast that sometimes you can have only a partial animal in the frame. Spypoint claims to have a 0.07sec trigger speed. I have no way of testing this claim, but for my application, the speed is enough. In fact, I don't think having more than that would even be a positive...

Here is an example on perfect lighting condition:

![Daylight Photo]({{ "/assets/img/posts/force11d/080816064642-min.JPG" | absolute_url }})

Night photo is produced with infrared light. Some people say that animals might be spooked by the dim red color that those cameras emit at night... however I have multiple photos of animals taken at night and they don't seem to be alarmed at all. Your mileage may differ of course, but for me, the red infrared light is cheaper to buy and don't seem to spook animal at all. Of course, photo quality suffers during night time, object and animal moving quickly appear blurry and you can lose important detail in the progress for example number of points on a deer.

Here is an example of a night photo:

## Video

Video quality on the Force-11D is on par with the picture quality. I love running my cameras in video mode when trying to pattern deer. I feel that video give me way more information than a photo would. For example, where did the deer came from, was he moving fast? slow? did he seem nervous? Those are a lot of question that can help you decide where to set a mobile set to strike when the opportunity arises.

I have no video available at the time, will add it here when available.

## Informations display

Spypoint will give you multiple information on your photos, it can for sure help you during your scouting and patterning effort. The informations displayed are as followed: Date, time, moon phase and temperature. They also print the Spypoint logo on the photo but it is small enough to not really bother.

## Conclusion

Although not perfect, the Spypoint Force-11D is what I consider to be my "main" camera. It gets the spot of choice and I used my other older models to "worse" spots. If I need to take a picture of a nice buck and know the pattern I am sure to put the Force-11D to the task. I also like using it when scouting new spot, in those case, I use the screen to have a perfect view of what I want to see without having to mess around with taking picture and looking with my phone how they look, or even worse, coming back 2 weeks later and the camera wasn't set  the . This is a really frustrating situation.

I would give this camera a solid 8.5/10. The really strong point of this camera is, of course, the display and the ease of use with all the control easily accessible from the front of the camera. Don't even need to get it off the tree to access the option. No side button. Everything is simple, from setting it up, to the setting screen. I would recommend getting a screw-in mount to get the best experience possible.
